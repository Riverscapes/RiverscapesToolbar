git 
- I want to see all projects in the online warehouse
    * Caveat: This is not a reporting tool. You will be able to see them by navigating to them.
- I want an indication of which of the projects in the online warehouse I have locally
- I want to select a single project that I don't already have and retrieve it
- I want an indication of which projects I have locally but are newer in the online warehouse (i.e. stale)
- I want to be able to pause, restart and abort downloads.
  - I don't want partial projects left on my computer
- I want at all times to be able to see and interact with the warehouse tree as well as the download queue (not necessarily at the same time)
- I want to be able to open a project as soon as its download is complete (even if other projects are still being downloaded)
