## Installing the plugin

***NB: We're still in development mode. These instructions will change when we deploy the plugin***

1. Make sure you have the AWS CLI tools installed and configured. (i.e. you've run `aws configure` and entered your keys)
2. Clone this repo (https://github.com/Riverscapes/RiverscapesToolbar) into your `~/.qgis2/python/plugins` folder
3. Start up QGIS and activate the plugin

## First time Setup

If this is your first time in the product you'll need to click the **settings** button and made sure it's pointing to a valid XML file for the remote and a valid, existing folder for the local data.
